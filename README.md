# Multi-Agent Systems
**Taken on: Washington University in Saint Louis, Spring 2017**

**Instructor: Sanmay Das**

The projects in class could be coded in any language, so I used Python for most of them (faster to do). 
Also, we experimented with **Linear Programming** (LP), which is a mathematical technique for maximizing
or minimizing a linear function of several variables, such as output or cost, subject to linear equality
and linear inequality constraints. The language used in LP was GLPK, which refers to the ```*.mod``` files

This course introduced the fundamental techniques and concepts needed to study multi-agent systems,
in which multiple autonomous entities with different information sets and goals interact.

We studied algorithmic, mathematical, and game-theoretic foundations, and how these foundations can help us
understand and design systems ranging from robot teams to online markets to social computing platforms.

Topics covered include **game theory**, distributed optimization, multi-agent learning and decision-making,
preference elicitation and aggregation, mechanism design, and incentives in social computing systems.

## The Prisoners Dilemma
One of the most famous problems or dilemmas in this field is what can be seen in the following image: **The Prisoners Dilemma**:
